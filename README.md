The BiSciCol codebase reads GUIDs that are linked to other GUIDs either through direct relations or sameAs expressions and infers relationships between them including children, parents, descendents, ancestors, and siblings.  A Loading package is included to take "triplified" datasets and index them within Virtuoso for use by the BiSciCol application (see the Triplifier Application).

Model Interfaces:
1) Virtuoso
2) File

Renderers:
1) Tree-based
2) Query by Type
3) HTML
4) Map

A REST interface is provided to query the codebase, upon which the BiSciCol interface is built.  For more information see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OFc9OkKM9wCCa2myRCQmiGLBK2y4Jcn9NNVbAeACY_s/edit?hl=en&authkey=CJK4hugF">BiSciCol Design Document</a>
